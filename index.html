        <span>Valorant Club meets every Tuesday and Wednesday after school in X2 from 2:40 to 4:30 pm.</span> <br>
        <p>Whether you're looking to play with friends, improve your skills, or just enjoy some solid competition, this is the place to be. <br> With high-performance computers running Valorant smoothly (100+ fps!), it's perfect for anyone who doesn’t have the gear at home.
        <br> <p>Not only will you get the chance to play in a fun, casual environment, but you’ll also have the opportunity to team up with fellow club members for competitive matches, improve your <br> gameplay, or get some coaching from the experienced players in our school’s esports scene.<br> </p>
        <p>Want to take your game to the next level? Queue up with others in the club, form a team, or simply play for fun—either way, there’s always a spot for you.<br>
         So, if you’ve got the drive, the competitive spirit, and want to meet others who are just as passionate about Valorant, come talk to Mr. Cresswell! </p>
